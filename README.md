For this project we had to combine the javescript skills we have aquired to assist us in writing a random password generator code.

The password characters choice which we had to give were both upper and lower case letters, symbols and numbers.

The most diffcult part of this project was the if/else statements and creating the loop. Which took much digging through different javascript websites to help.

Overall this project/homework is great to help display the basic understandings of javascript.
